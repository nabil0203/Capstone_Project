# Medical Store Management System

---

This console project implements a basic management system for a medical store. This system currently does not support advanced features such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or database integration. It operates as a basic console application that uses file handling to store and retrieve data. No concurrency support, so only one instance of the program should run at a time. Data is saved in plain text format, which is not encrypted. It was developed as a Capstone Project by TEAM_TITAN under the guidance of [Md. Abdul Hye Zebon](https://faculty.daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/profile/swe/zebon.html) Sir.
